<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Randall Wolfe, and I'm excited to share a little bit about myself with you.<br/>
  I grew up in Odessa, Tx, but now I currently go around and travel and work.<br/>
  I'm passionate about learning new skills that allow me to travel and work, which led me to my current profession as a Web Developer.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  I learned on my own and with some help from Bootcamps from UT Autsin, I was a CNC Machinist for 7 Years and wanted to do something that allowed me to be able to travel.<br/>
  Additionally, I've was a CNC Programer for CNC Machines and worked wit Lathes and Mills, which have helped me in my current career because it is a very techinal trade and skill that is very demanding.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  I have seven years of experience working in CNC Macining with diffrent type of indutry from Oil Field to Areospace.<br/>
  My work experience has allowed me to work on learn new concept, skills, and precision work that allowed me to travel across te country, which have been some of the highlights of my career.<br/>
  I've been fortunate to work with a lot of diffrent machining indutry and high end projects, where I've been able to carry this skill on to a new career path.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  In my free time, I'm passionate about giving back to my community.<br/>
  I started a small farming buiniess West Texas Farms, where I'm able to support, help and work with small and local business.<br/>
  Giving back to my community has been incredibly rewarding and has allowed me to make a positive impact<br/>
</p>
<p>
  I've faced several challenges and obstacles in my life, by not being able to afford to go to school to make something out if my self so I just started from sctrach and worked and leaned as much as I can with what I had available to me to be able to build myself to where I am at now.<br/>
  Overcoming these challenges has been difficult, but it has also been incredibly empowering and has taught me a lot of valuable life lessons.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  In my free time, I love to read books like The 4 Hour Work Week, Rich Dad Poor Dad, Self improvment and growth Books, and anythig that I am intrested in, and listen to music from artists like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Guns n Roses.<br/>
  I find that reading, doing activives that I enjoy doing, and listening to music help me unwind and relax after a long day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  I love to travel and have been fortunate to visit many incredible destinations, such as Austraila and Tasmania.<br/>
  Traveling has allowed me to experience new cultures, try new foods, making new and lasting friends, and making long lasting memories.<br/>
